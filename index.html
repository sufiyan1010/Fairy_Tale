   <div class="container">
    <p>Once upon a time, there was a beautiful princess who lived in a beautiful palace. There was a lake surrounding the palace garden. The princess had a golden ball and she loved to play with it. One day while playing in the garden, the ball fell into the lake. Feeling very upset and helpless, the young lady started weeping loudly for dropping her favourite ball into the lake.
        Upon hearing her wail, a frog hopped out of the lake and asked, “Why are you crying, sweet princess?” She told him about her golden ball which fell into the water and she did not know how to get it back. The frog quickly said, “I can help you to get your golden ball, but what will you give me in return?” The princess promised to give the frog anything that he desired.</p>

   The frog immediately dived into the lake and fetched the ball for the young princess. Seeing her ball, the princess was very happy. The frog then reminded her about her promise. The princess asked him, “What do you want me to do for you?” The frog replied, “Well! I want to be your friend, eat from your golden plate, and sleep in your palace!” However, the princess did not quite like his idea, but she agreed and rushed back to her palace.
    The next morning, the frog came to the palace and knocked on the door. The princess saw the frog but she didn’t open the door for him. He shouted from outside, “I have come to live with you in your palace, dear princess.” Hearing this, the princess started crying and ran to her fa­ther. When the kind-hearted king heard about the promise, he told her gently, “A promise is a promise and you must keep your word, my dear. You must allow the frog to stay with you in the palace.”

    <p>
        The princess was annoyed but she had no other choice but to let the nasty frog stay with her. That evening the frog sat next to the princess and had dinner from her golden plate. Thereafter, he followed her to the bedroom and jumped into her bed to sleep on her pillow. Seeing this, the princess got furious and picked him up from her bed and threw him against the wall in disgust. 

Suddenly, the nasty frog turned into a handsome prince. He told the princess that he was actually under the spell of a vicious witch, who had turned him into a frog. He was troubling her because he wanted someone to help him break the spell. Hearing this, the princess felt sorry for her misbehaviour and fell in love with the prince instantly. Soon after, they got married and lived happily ever after.<b>Despite the deal he asked her if she would accept to live with him instead of the ugly frog. She accepted and he told her how he became a frog because of a spell cast by an evil witch that could only be broken by a princess granting his wish. They got married and lived happily ever after.</b>
